/* Steps on how to build the game

	 1. Declare global variable e.g colours, target, finished
	 2. Create a function do_game()
	 2.1 Generate a random number that starts from 0 to length of colour array-1
	 2.2 Assign the variable "target" the colour generated from random number
	 2.3 Create a while loop which repeats until "finished" is true:
	 		* ask the player for their guess using prompt()
	 		* assign a variable "count" to count how many tries user attempt before he/she guess the correct answer and at every attempt increment by 1.
	 		* assign variable "finished" to a function check_guess() to check user guess 
	 3. Create a function check_guess() to check whether the user guess is:
	        * Not in the colour array. Show appropriate message and return false
	 		* Alphabetically higher than the target. Show appropriate message and return false
	 		* Alphabetically lower than the target. Show appropriate message and return false
	 		* Guess matches the random selected colour. Change the background colour to the target. Show appropriate message including the count of how many tries the user has made to guess the correct colour and return true.
